🚀 Roadmap Suggestions

Critical (Immediate Value)

Error Handling: Enhance yt-dlp error parsing. Currently, we catch generic errors. Parsing "Video unavailable" vs "Network error" vs "Geo-blocked" would be huge for UX.
Update Mechanism: yt-dlp updates frequently. An "Auto-update Binaries" button in Settings is essential to keep downloads working long-term.








Important (Core Experience)

Collections/Playlists: Support downloading entire YouTube playlists or channels in one go.
Metadata Editor: Allow users to edit ID3 tags (Artist, Album, Cover Art) before/after download.
Queue Management: Reordering downloads and "Download Later" scheduling.







Medium (Nice to Have)

Browser Extension: A Chrome/Edge extension to "Send to Downloader" directly.
FFmpeg Filters: UI for basic video editing (Trim, Convert format post-download, Volume boost).
Mobile Companion: A simple specific remote to queue downloads from phone to PC.
The app is now polished, documented, and ready for use! (Build is relaunching to show the new window controls).
